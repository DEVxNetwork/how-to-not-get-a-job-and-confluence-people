# How to not get a job and confluence people

---

## Hi

I'm AJ

Generally : I write code
Now : I create badly communicated professional documents

## Who is in the room?

* people that only want job offers from personal connections
* those who want a direction they can take their resume away from
* enjoyers of subverted expectations

---

## How do we ensure our resumes are left in the void?

* Obtuse Content
* Bad UI
* Frustrating UX

---

## Obtuse Content

##### The Header 

* just your favorite username
* unflattering headshot 
* supplying a mail address for responses
* links to your social media pages
* listing every technology you have every heard of in passing in round robin order 
* cat and friends as references with quotes

---

## Obtuse Content

#### The Body

* list experiences in chronological order 
* Experience unrelated to the position you are applying for 
* Long winded paragraphs 
* Dead links to projects with protocols
* Describing your contribution with vague adjectives
* linking directly to code only 
* ambiguous dates
* huge time gaps

---

## Obtuse Content

#### The Footer 

* unrelated facts about your personal life
* salary expectations

---

## Bad UI

* low contrast colors 
* non responsive design
* huge ambiguous images

---

## Frustrating UX

* nothing is selectable 
* superfluous animations
